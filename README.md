# Income_Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on census data using machine learning techniques.

The dataset includes various demographic and employment-related features. The model uses preprocessing, feature scaling, and classification algorithms to make predictions.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
- Classification using Logistic Regression (or your classifier)  
- Model evaluation with 10-fold cross-validation  
- Prediction on new data points  
- Performance metrics including accuracy and standard deviation  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
```bash
